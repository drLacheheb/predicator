# Predicator 🧠✨

Welcome to **Predicator** – a project that wants to **guess future exam questions** based on old ones!
Think of it like a smart study buddy 🤓 that learns from past exams (PDFs from students) to help you prepare for the next ones!

## What's Happening Right Now? 🚧

Currently, we are in **phase 1**:
**Teaching Predicator how to read old exam PDFs**.

Here’s what it’s learning to do:

1. **Read PDFs** you give it (old exams you’ve collected) 📄
2. **Find all the text & structure** inside (questions, answers, ...) ✏️
3. **Clean it up** so later on it can become smart enough to make predictions. 🧹

**Fancy AI predictions?**
Not yet… but stay tuned!

## Goals 🎯

* **Help students prep smarter:** Use past exams to get ahead of the game.
* **Make exam data tidy:** PDFs → structured, easy-to-use info.
